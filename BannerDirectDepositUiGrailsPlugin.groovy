    // Note: Using '0.1-SNAPSHOT' (to put a timestamp on the artifact) is not used due to GRAILS-5624 see: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILS-5624
    // Until this is resolved, Grails application's that use a SNAPSHOT plugin do not check for a newer plugin release, so that the
    // only way we'd be able to upgrade a project would be to clear the .grails and .ivy2 cache to force a fetch from our Nexus server.
    // Consequently, we'll use 'RELEASES' so that each project can explicitly identify the needed plugin version. Using RELEASES provides
    // more control on 'when' a grails app is updated to use a newer plugin version, and therefore 'could' allow delayed testing within those apps
    // independent of deploying a new plugin build to Nexus.
